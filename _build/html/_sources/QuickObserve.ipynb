    "# QuickObserve\n",
    "\n",
    "While `AutoObserve` will be the primary driver of nightly observations, it may be useful to be able to manually set up and run a night's worth of observing explictly (that is, no observing plans, simply write out in a script what you want the telescope to do). This is a similar method to how the old Narrowband `.sh` scripts worked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar functionality is provided by the `QuickObserve` class. The class is responsible for setting up a target and carrying out observations of it... and nothing more. That means it will slew to the target, set the tilts, start guiding, expose, stop guiding, and exit. Meanwhile, other things you may want (and need) to do should be done in a standalone script surrounding `observe` calls of a `QuickObserve` object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this looks in practice. Below is an example of a \"full night\" script, in which we establish two `QuickObserve` targets: M82, and some standard star. The needed primatives (direct control utility functions) are called to ensure everything surrounding the observation is as needed. And in this case, we do a flatfield run. "
