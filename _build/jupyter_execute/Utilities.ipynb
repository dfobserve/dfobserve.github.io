    "# Utilities \n",
    "\n",
    "The following indicates some of the base-level utilities present in the package, which can be used interactively in a \"line by line\" observing style. This is particularly useful for testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a note, the `DFObserve` package directory (i.e., the outermost directory) contains a file called `interactive_startup.py`. This file contains a bunch of imports to get all the organized utility functions into your interactive Python session in one go, defines a few helper functions, etc. I recommend running this Python file when running interactively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The utilities are all stored in the `dfobserve.utils` submodule, and are organized by the following: Cameras, Filter Tilters, FlipFlats, Hardware, Mount, Network, NMS (New Mexico Skies), and The Sky X. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Camera Utils \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful set of utils for testing, these allow you to take exposures through the webserver. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `AllExpose`: Take an exposure. Supply `exptime`, `which` (to send command to, as recognized by `SendWebRequestNB`), a dictionary of any extras (like `savedir`), and any `**kwargs` recognized by `SendWebRequestNB`. A useful one is `skip`, which lets you skip sending the command to a list of units. \n",
    "- `AllScienceExposure`: Take an exposure in which the ons (narrowband units) take an exposure while the offs take shorter, multiple exposures during. \n",
    "- `AllFlatFieldExposure`: Take a flat on all units (or well, whichever specified by `which`). Relies on you having closed and turned on the flip flats first. \n",
    "- `AllDarkExposure`: Similar but for darks. \n",
    "- `Autofocus`: This runs the focus-run script (by Jeff). Has a bunch of params. \n",
    "- `AllSetCameraTemperatures`: set the camera temps. If you pick a number > 15, it disables the coolers. \n",
    "- `AllCheckCameraTemperatures`: Check that the camera temps are within tolerence of some desired value. \n",
    "\n",
